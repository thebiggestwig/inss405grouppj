GROUP 2 - BLACKJACK GAME

For our final project, Group 2 has developed a Blackjack Game using Python. It is made for the user to play against the system using a series of math
functions as well as else/if statements and input/print commands. Our goal was the cover all the topics we've learned over the course of the semester 
to make something engaging and fun. 

This project taught me how to add parameters to a function such that it only runs when a specific scenario is met. In the case of our Blackjack game,
this appears by the function still running and continually hitting the dealer if the total sum of his cards is under 17. I believe this can be very
useful in different loop functions by enabling a heightened sense of outcome control. The toughest part of this project was keeping track of the different variables used and searching some of the proper functions such as sample() to ensure that the code runs and works smoothly.
