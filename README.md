GROUP 2 - BLACKJACK GAME

For our final project, Group 2 has developed a Blackjack Game using Python. It is made for the user to play against the system using a series of math
functions as well as else/if statements and input/print commands. Our goal was the cover all the topics we've learned over the course of the semester 
to make something engaging and fun.
